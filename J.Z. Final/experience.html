          <P>
            This sprawling megalopolis can be dizzying, but a selection of neighborhoods offers just the right balance of art, nightlife and cuisine.
          </P>
          <p>
            Contemplating the physical sprawl of Tokyo is dizzying. The Japanese megalopolis has no discernible center, and clusters of skyscrapers miles apart defy the idea of a downtown core. The busiest areas — from Shibuya in the west to Ginza in the east — are electrifying hives of activity. But when time is limited, don’t be distracted by the hypnotic, multistory video screens. Instead, focus on a diverse cross-section of neighborhoods, from peaceful Nakameguro to eclectic Koenji, for a taste of this capital that will leave you hungry for more.
          <p>
            There are two reasons to begin in Aoyama. The first is to witness Tokyo’s recent boom of luxury boutiques with fancy facades designed by architecture’s stars, such as Herzog & de Meuron’s Prada and Miu Miu stores. The second is to visit the Nezu Museum. Housed in a harmonious new building by the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, the expanded museum has six galleries displaying pre-modern Japanese and East Asian art, from delicate Edo-era gold-foil paintings to moody 15th-century splashed-ink landscapes. In the adjoining garden, stone walkways and a carp-filled pond frame seasonal tableaus of crimson maples in autumn and blooming irises in spring. Regular admission, 1,100 Japanese yen (about $10).
          </p>
          <p>
          The epicure who wants to engage in mindful drinking will find enlightenment on one of the eight seats in the spartan, Zen-like cocktail den Gen Yamamoto. The bar itself is a slab of Japanese oak behind which the eponymous bartender, clad in a crisp white jacket, mixes his creations with precision. The cocktails, in exquisite glassware, balance spirits with fresh seasonal ingredients, including kumquats from Kagawa or fava beans from Kagoshima. A four-cocktail tasting menu is 4,500 yen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wander through the narrow lanes of Nakameguro, a laid-back neighborhood bisected by the leafy canal of the Meguro River, to dinner at Nakameguro Iguchi, a stylish second-floor yakitori restaurant. A single bonsai serves as décor behind the 10-seat bar, where the friendly chef twirls skewers over the charcoal grill. The set menu, nearly two-dozen courses, recently included the usual chicken bits — tail, heart, wing — and creative offerings like grilled caciocavallo cheese from Hokkaido and refreshing chawanmushi (egg custard) with avocado, seasonal asparagus and lemon peel. Dinner for two, about 15,000 yen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leave the neon frenzy of Shibuya to the teeny-boppers and instead seek out night life in Shimokitazawa, two miles to the west. This cool indie neighborhood is home to many small music spots, called “live houses,” that host shows ranging from avant-garde pop to punk. At Shelter, a former bomb shelter, watch up-and-coming local rock bands on the checkerboard stage.
          </p>
          <p>
          Avoid Roppongi after dark when its rowdy clubs fill with inebriated expats, and instead visit the neighborhood when the sun shines on its cultural institutions. Start at the National Art Center, one of the largest exhibition halls in Asia. Beyond the curving glass-and-steel facade, find world-class collections, including the current Yayoi Kusama show (through May 22; admission varies). Then walk to 21_21 Design Sight, a bunkerlike museum with underground galleries that was created by the designer Issey Miyake and the architect Tadao Ando. Exhibitions delve into how design informs everyday life (admission, 1,100 yen).
          </p>
          <p>
          Dinners at Tokyo’s top sushi bars typically end with bills printed with an immodest number of zeros, but you can fulfill your sushi dreams for a fraction of the price by eating at midday. Reserve a spot at Sushi Rin, a hushed second-story space in Kagurazaka with about a dozen seats around a blond-wood bar. At lunchtime, the omakase meal (4,000 yen) features fewer courses but the same craftsmanship and top-notch products, from a spoonful of salty roe atop vinegared rice to a parade of nigiri including red snapper, silvery kohada fish and rich tuna belly brushed with soy sauce. Equally memorable is the artful presentation on beautiful plates beside crimson cut-glass sake sets.
          <p>
            Browse Tokyo’s retail options at two shopping complexes on opposite ends of the style spectrum. Start in Kagurazaka at La Kagu, a former book warehouse that reopened in 2014 as a shop, cafe and bookstore reached via snaking timber-and-steel staircases designed by Kengo Kuma. The airy two-story space stocks fashions and housewares, from tailored silk trousers and teak Danish bar carts to tiny wooden hand-carved creamers. Then head west to Koenji’s Kitakore building, a riotous, ramshackle warren of closet-size shops overflowing with customized clothing and labels you won’t find anywhere else. Looking for a lace-trimmed ’80s-era Mickey Mouse sweatshirt? Or a purple motorcycle jacket with sparkly studs, mirrors and a gorilla hologram? This is the spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take the train one stop east to Nakano, a neighborhood favored by otaku (young pop-culture fanatics), to find a pair of drinking spots worth obsessing over. Hidden amid the manga stores and costume shops in a labyrinthine subculture shopping complex is Bar Zingaro, a cafe that fuses Norwegian exports — midcentury Scandinavian furnishings, Fuglen coffee — with the colorful art of Takashi Murakami. Tucked down a nearby alley, Nakano Beer Kobo is a tiny bar that feels like a treehouse with particleboard walls and lofts that you can climb into with plates of fried chicken thighs and mugs of cold beer brewed on site.
